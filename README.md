This is a technical assignment for the data engineer / data scientist position at CREA.

# Assignment #1 - Data analysis and visualisation

We at CREA have developed an online system that collects air pollution data from a dozen sources globally. In this assignment, we would like you to extract and present some insights using this dataset. Namely, we would like you to present in a single graph (subplots/facets authorised):

- the share of population covered by stations within radii of 5, 10, 50km and beyond for US, UK, Turkey, Thailand, Philippines, India. Population data available here: [data/gpw_v4_population_density_rev11_2020_15_min.tif](data/gpw_v4_population_density_rev11_2020_15_min.tif).

You can use either R or Python for data analysis, and any library or platform to create charts, except Tableau and PowerBI. Code and results can be hosted on a Markdown document, Jupyter notebook, R markdown, simple code and images, or interactive web page.

# Assignment #2 - Data scraping and distributing

Here is a portal to access India's air quality: [CPCB](https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing/data)

Collect PM2.5 daily data for all stations located in Kolkata and Lucknow using code only, and plot 365-day running average for these two cities from 2020 onward, using stations average.

# Assignment #3 - Data structure

What would be your suggested and/or favourite stack to collect and serve air pollution data to users? (e.g. regular scraping, backend, data storage, frontend). Please provide justification or explanation if you have any. Keep it short!

# Comments

We are interested in the way you solve the problems, howtructure your code and how you present results. There is no particular trap, but if you have any doubt or question, feel free to contact [me](hubert@energyandcleanair.org) directly.

# Submission

Steps:

- fork this repository;
- push your code, results and answers;
