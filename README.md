# Technical Assignment

This is a technical assignment for the data engineer / data scientist position at CREA.

## Part 1a - Data analysis and visualisation

We at CREA have developed an online system that collects air pollution data from a dozen sources globally. In this assignment, we would like you to extract and present some insights using this dataset. Namely, we would like you to present in a single graph (subplots/facets authorised):

- the share of population covered by stations within radii of 5, 10, 50km and beyond for US, UK, Turkey, Thailand, Philippines, India. Population data available here: [data/gpw_v4_population_density_rev11_2020_15_min.tif](data/gpw_v4_population_density_rev11_2020_15_min.tif).

You can use either R or Python for data analysis, and any library or platform to create charts, except Tableau and PowerBI. Code and results can be hosted on a Markdown document, Jupyter notebook, R markdown, simple code and images, or interactive web page.

## Part 1b (Optional) - Data scraping and visualisation

If you have no experience with geospatial data and find yourself struggling with Part 1a, you can work on Part 1b instead. If you have finished Part 1a, you can skip directly to Part 2.

Here is a portal to access India's air quality: [CPCB](https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing/data)

Collect PM2.5 daily data for all stations located in Kolkata and Lucknow using code only, and provide an **interactive** 365-day running average chart for these two cities from 2020 onward, using stations average.

## Part 2 - Data structure

What would be your suggested and/or favourite stack to collect and serve air pollution data to users? (e.g. regular scraping, backend, data storage, frontend). Please provide justification or explanation if you have any. Keep it short!

## Comments

We are interested in the way you solve the problems, howtructure your code and how you present results. There is no particular trap, but if you have any doubt or question, feel free to contact [me](hubert@energyandcleanair.org) directly.

## Submission

Steps:

- fork this repository;
- push your code, results and answers;
- invite [me](hubert@energyandcleanair.org) as a collaborator on your repository once you are done.

If required, you can push your results to another platform and share the link(s) with me.
